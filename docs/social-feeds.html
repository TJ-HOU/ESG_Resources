I've looked into a few options, including Wharton ESG courses offered through Coursera and the CFA ESG certificate. However, what disappoints me is that those options only cover very high level descriptions. I'd like to have a training that's practical; one that walks you through concrete examples on how to use ESG data and/or platforms step by step to evaluate an investment, make investment decisions, and/or construct/monitor a portfolio.\n\nIf the training is project-based so you can use ESG data to come up with your own analysis, that's even better. I have investment background and I'm thinking about transitioning my career into ESG investment. At the same time, I don't mind paying money for high quality training as long as the content is practical and can provide hands-on experience.\n\nI know ESG investing lacks standards and can be subjective, which is OK as long as the framework is sound. I just want to learn how professionals do their jobs.\n\nIf anyone is doing this professionally, I'd also really appreciate a conversation.\n\nThanks for any recommendations!","Hey everyone, I wanted to share a project idea with all of you, and I'd love to hear your initial thoughts or reactions. 💡 \n\nAs someone who cares about impact and esg-related issues, I've been wondering lately how my various investments (eg. 401k, mutual funds, etfs) stack up when it comes to esg issues as well as relating to my personal values. The problem, I realized, was that when I click on my accounts in Charles Schwab or SoFi, for example, I have no idea for what all the companies are that I'm actually invested in. If anything, I see the top 10 holdings in a fund, but that usually amounts for less than 10% of the fund's holdings.\n\nI'm thinking of building a tool that lets people see the companies they're invested in through their accounts along with those individual companies' esg performance. I'm also envisioning a way for people to see how values aligned their investments currently are -- as opposed to having to go out and put more money into the market in an esg focused fund (where you don't even know all the companies in that fund).\n\nIs this something that resonates with y'all? Do you have ideas for what you'd like to see in something like this? Any and all feedback is much appreciated :)","Hey there, does anyone have some good recommendations for EV related Stocks and ETFs to consider investing in besides Tesla ?","","","","","","food for thought as to ESG investors addressing matters at hand:  \n\n\nGreenwashing Is Increasingly Making ESG Moot\n\nFossil fuel holdings, Russia’s war and revelations about who’s investing there are battering the strategy’s original meaning.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/greenwashing-is-increasingly-making-esg-investing-moot-green-insight](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/greenwashing-is-increasingly-making-esg-investing-moot-green-insight)\n\nBy Tim Quinson\n\nMarch 16, 2022, 3:00 AM MST  \n\n\n\"...

Somewhat the Bogle heads 3-fund portfolio idea...but minus bonds since I'm 26 and not incorporating them into my retirement investments yet.\n* Largely just negative ESG screened companies, but then also a slight shift to positive ESG screened companies\n* Low expense ratios of less than 0.5%\n\nSo I've been thinking this...\n\n75% negative screened ESG funds / 25% positive screened ESG funds ... both trying to be the total world market.\n\n|FUND|MARKET|ESG TYPE|ALLOCATION|EXPENSE RATIO|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CRBN** \\- iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF|Total Market|Negative ESG Screened|75%|0.2%|\n|**USXF** \\- iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF|US Market|Positive ESG Screened|15%|0.1%|\n|**DMXF** \\- iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF|International Market ex-US|Positive ESG Screened|7%|0.12%|\n|**EMXF** \\- iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EM ETF|Emerging Market|Positive ESG Screened|2%|0.16%|\n|**ICLN -** iShares Global Clean Energy ETF|Clean Energy Market|Clean Energy Sector ETF|1%|0.42%|\n\nMajority of the fund is just the total market CRBN ETF that has some like 1200 stocks to try and get as close to something like a VT Total Market ETF. Then the last quarter is of positive screened ESG funds. There are no good world market positive screened ESG funds so I tried to split as best I could figure out like how VT is. Lastly, I put a tiny amount to clean energy ETF. I thought about Invesco ERTH here instead but it's done worst and has a higher expense ratio. VanEck's SMOG also looked good.\n\nI felt like reading the holdings and the expense ratios, iShares had the best product overall. I considered others like some from Invesco, Fidelity (my broker), and Vanguard...but iShares always seemed slightly better. In some form of, their ESG ratings and what the fund holds, expense ratios, or how diversified it is.\n\nBefore I had a mixture of like Fidelity mutual funds they have...but they just lacked due to high expense ratios or not really a good screen of ESG values I thought.\n\nThough I do like the just dump money into a mutual fund and forget it aspect...ETFs you have to like have that one extra step of figuring out how much my monthly deposit translates into the ETFs. This could keep simple where like...I could just buy CRBN throughout the year and then each year rebalance....rather than screwing around each month trying to balance it out perfectly.\n\nAny thoughts?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","We're a mid sized accounting firm in Toronto, Ontario and recently interviewed CEO's from emerging industries includes ESG companies.

My belief in an impending ESG movement, coupled with a fascination of carbon markets has landed me directly into the energy sector. The only issue I found was that it is hard to determine what I am looking at while reading a renewable energy PR claiming “100MW solar farms!” for example. So I decided to have a chat with someone who knows energy and film the pod. If you’re interested in a basic overview of energy, how renewables may effect the grid, and what sources of power may be necessary in the future.. Here it is.\n\nTav's 2 Cents - Jake Tanner\nhttps://youtu.be/ziPKLbt3ArM","","Over the last 5-10 years, there has been a tidal wave of investment funds, all claiming to have Impact Investing focus. In a time where we need more investment going into societal and environmental restoration, this development is encouraging.\n\nWe often don’t see so many investment professionals raise money, governmental institutions allocate money or asset owners invest their own to fix or improve society.\n\nThat’s admirable and noble. Billions have been raised to help fix societal and environmental challenges. Should we be thrilled or skeptical? I choose the latter.\n\nIf one looks at some of the mission statements or ambitions of several of the funds created recently, we can only feel that the tide is turning:\n\n“investment platform focused on generating superior returns aligned with sustainable principles.”\n\n“Assist great entrepreneurs developing products and services for the three billion people in the bottom half of the world’s economic pyramid.”\n\n“We invest to build more inclusive and equitable societies.”\n\n“We back founders on a mission to build a better world.”\n\n“dedicated to startups leveraging exponentially accelerating technologies to address humanity’s grand challenges.”\n\n“investing into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.”\n\n“seeking deeper positive net impact across the spectrum of capital.”\n\n“We believe that investment capital can help meet large-scale global challenges.”\n\n“enables private sector investment in projects aimed at climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries.”\n\n“We back entrepreneurs building climate tech for a regenerative world.”\n\n“Our ambition is to identify and invest in high- impact solutions for climate mitigation, as well as to catalyse and multiply capital to scale them.”\n\n“family office investing in regenerative food systems.”\n\n“vision to invest in entrepreneurs building sustainable enterprises that can catalyze development impact for excluded communities and remote geographies across the globe.”\n\n“support promising entrepreneurs, with growth capital and proven business tools to reach their full potential and enable them to achieve systemic change.”\n\n“backs technology businesses committed to having a positive impact that answers the most pressing social and ecological challenges of our time, in a way that is both scalable and sustainable.”\n\n“invests in companies driving measurable social impact alongside business performance and strong returns.”\n\n“we believe that we can address and alleviate some of the world’s challenges by investing with purpose.“\n\nFalse packaging\n\nMission statements are intended to inspire and act as a flag in the ground and where the organization intends to go. My question is: are these investment funds or investors really purpose driven or do they revert to a traditional investment mind set of ‘hunting unicorns’?\n\nWe are talking about those companies that will have a 1 billion dollar valuation. Isn’t that the purpose of investments to maximise returns for the investor. That is why they are hired and compensated. No issue there.\n\nMy issue is with the false packaging. If you are just hunting unicorns, just say so, so the entrepreneur won’t lose any time whose mission is not to be a unicorn, but a zebra (focusing on improving society and environment, not exponential growth) . Most investments will never be unicorns.\n\nWhen the fit is wrong\n\nIt is hard to start and run a company and do the continuous capital raise. They should not be wasting their time with investors that want to be entertained, informed or are pretending to be interested when they are just researching competitive investments.\n\nPerhaps the most important question to ask an investor is: ‘Are you an unicorn hunter?’ If they are and your ambition is to drawdown carbon by improving the soil and livelihoods of small holder farmers, without any apps, then the fit is wrong.\n\nIf you want to create meaningful jobs for unemployed youth by doing vocational hospitality training then unicorn hunters are not going to help or invest. If you are a long term developer to de-commoditise the food system then don’t bother with unicorn hunters.\n\nIf the mission or purpose is your raison d’être, then you are not helped and won’t get money from unicorn hunters. They are looking for an app, few employees, super-fast scaling, warp speed growth and monopoly. It is a win-lose approach mindset.\n\nBe discerning\n\nMany investors and most VCs are fund managers driven by achieving the carry, asap. Few ever ran a company. Growth, market share and IPOs are the mantra. They are looking for that big payoff asap. Zebras won’t do that, unicorns will. Maybe they will. At least in the eyes of unicorn hunters they will.\n\nIf you are looking to fundamentally restore the social and environmental balance first and foremost, as well as make a profit to fund all your activities and growth, avoid unicorn hunters. Especially those pretending to be impact Investors. Those are the worst. They wrap themselves in something that is important to you, but has no value at all to them. Be discerning. Ask them are you a UH (unicorn hunter) or II (Impact Investor)?\n\nAs Groucho Marx stated it: 'The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.'","","","","Hi - I think this essay also appeared as an advertisement in the print media in November:\n\n[https://clim8invest.com/climate-change/esg-is-bs-we-need-climate-impact/](https://clim8invest.com/climate-change/esg-is-bs-we-need-climate-impact/)ESG is BS.

Investors need a new category that does what it says on the tin – Climate Impact.  \n>  \n>In the past few years, a tsunami of money, trillions of dollars have moved into so-called ESG investment funds. Yet despite supposedly screening for environmental, social and governance issues, it is shocking that the world’s 20 largest ESG funds hold on average 17 fossil fuel companies in each of their portfolios. And it’s not just fossil fuels – they also hold tobacco, weapons and alcohol1.  \n>  \n>Many ESG funds also have Big Tech in their top five holdings. Investing into Facebook is not making any difference on climate change. Google’s parent company Alphabet is the most common stock in the top 20 ESG funds2. Although Google has made much effort to green the energy usage of its data centres, their core product is not making a positive impact on climate change."," In the 13 or so years since the publication of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto¹ that launched the cryptocurrency digital wave with the introduction of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets has exploded to over $2.23 trillion².  This growth has largely taken place in the last five years, since about July 2017.  The number of cryptocurrencies in the market has also expanded dramatically along with the number of investors.  While new cryptocurrencies are constantly being created and quite a number have reportedly failed, it is estimated that there are currently more than 13,506 in existence³  The market is highly concentrated with the top ten cryptocurrencies representing 80% of the market cap.  Based on a new Pew Research Center survey, the majority of U.S. adults have heard at least a little about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and 16% say they personally have invested in, traded or otherwise used one.  In the meantime, increasing focus on climate change has directed attention on the usage of energy by cryptocurrencies in the mining process and the resultant levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  This, even as [calculating the energy use of cryptocurrencies](https://sustainableinvest.com/environmental-considerations-for-sustainable-cryptocurrency-investors/)\n\nis exceedingly difficult due to the many parameters at play and spotty data.","Ahead of the conclusion on November 13, 2021 of the Glasgow Climate Pact negotiations, it was reported that the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) had attracted 220 signatories with $57 trillion in assets under management, including some of the largest asset managers in the US.  These signatories include firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors, JPMorgan Asset Management, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Wellington and Neuberger Berman.  More signatories are expected to follow.  Initially launched in December 2020, the initiative aims to galvanize the asset management industry to commit to the goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with efforts under the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming “to well below 2℃, preferably to 1.5℃, compared to pre-industrial levels.” By agreeing to shift investing to align with [net zero emissions¹ by 2050 or earlier](https://sustainableinvest.com/net-zero-asset-managers-initiative-invites-stakeholder-questions/), this private sector initiative, along with other such undertakings, provides support to governments in their leadership efforts to address the severe consequences of climate change and to limit emissions.","I'm disappointed they don't seem to go after accounting for  loans for purchasing hydrocarbon-burning vehicles, but otherwise this  looks very informative, and they do disclaim that scope 3 is omitted which  allows for some future improvement in the analysis.\n\n[https://www.carbonbubble.net/](https://www.carbonbubble.net/)\n\nThe Global Emissions of the US Financial Sector\n\nUS  banks and asset managers are financing climate breakdown.

A contributing factor to the slowing growth may be the three consecutive monthly declines in the average performance of green bond funds relative to equity funds that were up 5.13% according to the S&P 500 during the same time interval. ","","The very hot market for SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, has also introduced potential investment opportunities for sustainability-minded retail and institutional investors.  In more recent years, in addition to SPACs established solely to raise capital through an initial public offering for the purpose of acquiring unspecified existing companies, a significant number of SPAC offerings have been issued with an investing strategy focused on social and environmental themes, the achievement of impact as well as the integration of ESG in the investment process.  In fact, according to [research conducted by Sustainable Research and Analysis](https://sustainableinvest.com/sustainable-investing-with-spacs/), the SPAC universe, which consists of 533 listed entities with a combined deal value of $171.0 billion, also includes 163 SPACs, or 31% outstanding SPACs as of mid-March 2021 based on deal value that can be classified under one of these sustainable investing strategies; health, ESG integration, new energy, education, social infrastructure, education/health, inclusive economy and impact (UN SDG-Focused).","","**Confession:** \n\n\\- ESG investing was never something I much cared for.

Increasing adverse effects from climate change to households, communities, and businesses will exacerbate climate-related risks to the U.S. and global financial systems if not addressed.”  FSOC notes that 2020 was a “historic year of extremes” for the United States, based on data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). ","","A number of organizations seem to be very involved with platforming and promoting disinformation whether in the stolen election lie, pandemic disinformation or disinformation about the very real climate emergency.
